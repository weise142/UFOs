# UFOs
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage of UFO sightings that accepts user inputs and adjusts the display and information for these inputs. The webpage is setup in a table format so users can filter UFO sightings based on different or multiple criteria such as event date, city, and shape.
